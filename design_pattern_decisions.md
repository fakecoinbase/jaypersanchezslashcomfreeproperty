## Comfree Property Design Pattern Decision
The design pattern approached is the state machine pattern.  Each contract acts independently and each transaction is checked for owner.  The pattern is implemented and tested in 0_test_OfferContract.js.  You will notice a note when a SalesConditionContract contract is initiated, the first check is that the OfferContract has a state accepted set to true, otherwise, the test section of SalesCondition will fail.  The test secion of EscrowContract will also fail if the isMetConditionList function in SalesConditionContract is not met.
